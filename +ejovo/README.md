# +ejovo

Welcome to the ejovo package. The code in this package was initially written for my senior thesis but heavily expanded upon during my time as a Physics Research Assistant working with Dr. Dave Wilson at Kalamazoo College. Here is a brief overview of the directories contained in this package

* **+fn/** - This package contains essential functions that aid in the instantiation of virus objects. Some automation example that this package provides is automatically downloading virus pdbs from the [VIPERdb](http://viperdb.scripps.edu/), determining the T-number of a virus, and importing virus coordinates into MATLAB
* **+golden/** - This package contains a variety of constants that are relavent to viruses and other classes in the ejovo package. Most importantly, +golden stores the golden ratio phi, after which this package is named.
* **+saf/** - The heart and soul of my research. Check out this package for awesome animations and high resolution plots
* **+v/** - The second most important package. Contains the @virus class and all of its derivatives.
* **+wilson/** - Essential functions written by Dr. Dave
* **@pointArray** - 3d icosahedral structures whose symmetry is extended radially by affine extensions
* **media/** - All the gifs, pdfs, and pngs to make this repo come to life.
